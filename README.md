## 🎯 Project Overview

**AI Safety Guardian** is a real-time safety monitoring application built using **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**. It uses **YOLOv8** pose estimation and object detection models to continuously monitor live video feeds, detect potential dangers like **human falls** and **fire/smoke**, and instantly trigger **email alerts + audio alarms**.

> 🏢 **Real-world use case:** Hospitals, factories, elderly care homes, and warehouses need 24/7 human monitoring — this system automates that at near-zero cost.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧍 **Fall Detection** | YOLOv8-Pose detects human posture and flags dangerous falls |
| 🔥 **Fire Detection** | YOLOv8 + color masking to identify fire or smoke in real-time |
| ⏱️ **3-Second Confirmation Logic** | Smart fall confirmation system — avoids false alarms by confirming fall persists for 3 seconds |
| 📧 **Email Alerts** | Instant email notification sent to configured receiver on confirmed threat |
| 🔔 **Audio Alarm** | Plays alarm.wav immediately on threat detection |
| 📊 **Live Dashboard** | Real-time Streamlit dashboard showing live feed, confidence scores, and alert history |
| 🗂️ **Alert History** | Timestamped log of all past alerts displayed in sidebar |
| 🎮 **Demo Video Mode** | Upload a video file to test the system without a webcam (cloud-compatible) |

## 🧠 Technical Implementation

### Fall Detection Logic
- Uses **YOLOv8n-pose** to extract 17 body keypoints per person
- Analyzes keypoint positions (shoulder, hip, knee, ankle) to determine body angle
- Implements **3-second persistence check** — fall is only confirmed if it persists, preventing false alarms
- Confidence score displayed in real-time on dashboard

### Fire Detection Logic
- Uses **YOLOv8n** object detector for smoke/fire object classification
- Combined with **HSV color masking** for reliable fire color range detection
- Dual-method approach increases detection accuracy

### Alert Escalation System
```
Threat Detected
    ↓
3-Second Confirmation (Fall) / Instant (Fire)
    ↓
Audio Alarm (alarm.wav) + Email Alert
    ↓
Alert Logged with Timestamp → Dashboard History
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Webcam (for live mode) or video file (for demo mode)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/muhammedshemeer/AI_Safety_Guardian.git
cd AI_Safety_Guardian

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Set up environment variables
